# <span style="color: #4CAF50; animation: fadeIn 2s;">Shell Scripting</span>

Shell scripting allows you to automate tasks and control your system through commands executed in a shell. It is essential for system administrators, developers, and anyone looking to streamline their workflows.

## Why Use Shell Scripting?

- **Automates repetitive tasks** like backups and file management.
- **Saves time** by reducing manual effort and human error.
- **Provides system control**, allowing you to interact with files, processes, and configurations at a low level.
